Robert started producing music at the age of 8 when he received his first musical instrument for his birthday - an Acoustic Guitar which he still plays to this day.
At the age of 15 he started producing trance and uploading them to youtube under the alias "Robert J.C".  As Dubstep grew throughout 2010 Robert took a shine to this new genre.
